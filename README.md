# Student-Register

Implemented classes Student, Course, Attainment and StudentRegister for maintaining student data. 

You may test your class implementations by using the test program given in the file StudentRegisterTest.java, 
the example data in the files students.txt, courses.txt and attainments.txt, and the example output in the file output.txt. 
Place these files and your own classes into the same directory, compile the program e.g. as javac *.java, and run the test 
as java StudentRegisterTest students.txt courses.txt attainments.txt. The program output should be identical with the example output given in the file output.txt.
